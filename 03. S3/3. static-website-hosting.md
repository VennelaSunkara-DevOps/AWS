# Static Website Hosting Using AWS S3 (Complete Documentation)

## 1. What is Static Website Hosting in S3?

In **Amazon S3**, static website hosting allows you to host **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images** directly from an S3 bucket **without any server**.

A **static website** means:

* No backend code execution (no Java, Node.js, PHP)
* Only client-side files
* Faster, cheaper, highly scalable

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before starting, you must have:

* AWS account
* Static website files such as:

  * `index.html`
  * `style.css`
  * `script.js`
  * `images/`

**Important rule**

* The homepage file name must match the **Index document** (example: `index.html`)

---

## 3. Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket

1. Login to **AWS Console**
2. Go to **S3 → Create bucket**
3. Enter **Bucket name**

   * Must be globally unique
   * Example: `kkfunda-static-site-2025`
4. Select **AWS Region**
5. Click **Create bucket**

---

## 4. Step 2: Upload Website Files

1. Open the bucket
2. Click **Upload**
3. Upload **all website files and folders**
4. Maintain folder structure exactly as local system

Example:

```
index.html
css/style.css
js/app.js
images/logo.png
```

---

## 5. Step 3: Enable Static Website Hosting

1. Open the bucket
2. Go to **Properties**
3. Scroll to **Static website hosting**
4. Click **Edit**
5. Enable **Static website hosting**
6. Select **Host a static website**
7. Set:

   * Index document: `index.html`
   * Error document: `error.html` (optional)
8. Save changes

After saving, you will get a **Bucket website endpoint URL**.

---

## 6. Step 4: Permissions (MOST IMPORTANT SECTION)

Static website hosting **will NOT work** unless the correct permissions are set.

This section explains **what to check, what to disable, and what to add**.

---

## 6.1 Block Public Access (Mandatory to Modify)

By default, S3 blocks all public access.

### Steps:

1. Bucket → **Permissions**
2. Click **Edit** under **Block public access**
3. **Uncheck all 4 options**
4. Save changes
5. Confirm acknowledgement

 This is required because static websites must be publicly readable.

---

## 6.2 Object Ownership (ACL Handling)

### Check this setting:

1. Bucket → **Permissions**
2. Scroll to **Object Ownership**
3. Ensure:

   * **Bucket owner enforced (ACLs disabled)** is selected

This avoids ACL conflicts and is AWS-recommended.

---

## 6.3 Bucket Policy (REQUIRED)

You must explicitly allow **public read access** for website files.

### Add the following Bucket Policy

1. Bucket → **Permissions**
2. Scroll to **Bucket policy**
3. Click **Edit**
4. Paste the policy below (replace bucket name)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadForStaticWebsite",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

5. Save changes

### What this policy does

* Allows **any user on the internet**
* To **read objects**
* Inside your bucket
* Required for website access

---

## 6.4 IAM Permissions (For the User Uploading Files)

The IAM user/role you use must have at least:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:PutObject",
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:ListBucket"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME",
    "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
  ]
}
```

Without this:

* Upload may fail
* Files may not be visible
* Access denied errors occur

---

## 7. Step 5: Access the Website

1. Bucket → **Properties**
2. Scroll to **Static website hosting**
3. Copy **Bucket website endpoint**
4. Open URL in browser

Example:

```
http://kkfunda-static-site-2025.s3-website-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
```

---

## 8. Common Errors and Fixes (Real-Time Issues)

### 403 Access Denied

**Cause**

* Bucket policy missing
* Block public access still enabled

**Fix**

* Recheck section 6.1 and 6.3

---

### 404 Not Found

**Cause**

* `index.html` missing
* Wrong index document name

**Fix**

* Verify file exists at root
* Check exact spelling

---

### CSS / Images Not Loading

**Cause**

* Wrong relative paths in HTML

**Fix**

* Use correct paths:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
<img src="images/logo.png">
```

---

## 9. Important Limitations (Must Know)

* S3 static website hosting supports **HTTP only**
* No HTTPS
* No server-side processing
* Public access is mandatory

---

## 10. When to Use This Approach

Best suited for:

* HTML/CSS/JS templates
* Portfolio websites
* Company landing pages
* Documentation websites
* Demo projects

## 11. Summary (One-Line Explanation)

# IAM Credential Report – In-Depth Explanation

IAM Credential Report is an **account-level security report** that provides a **full view of IAM user credentials and their usage status**.

It helps answer one core question:

> **Are IAM credentials created, used, rotated, and secured properly?**

---

## What Exactly Is an IAM Credential Report

The IAM Credential Report is a **CSV file** generated by AWS that contains **credential details of all IAM users in the account**.

It includes information such as:

* Password usage
* Access key usage
* MFA status
* Credential age
* Last used timestamps
* Whether credentials are active or inactive

This report is mainly used for:

* **Security audits**
* **Compliance checks**
* **Credential hygiene**
* **Periodic access reviews**

---

## Important Characteristics

* Scope: **Entire AWS account**
* Covers: **Only IAM users**
* Does NOT include:

  * IAM roles
  * Root user (except a separate root summary)
  * SSO users (IAM Identity Center)

---

## Where to Find Credential Report (UI)

1. AWS Console → **IAM**
2. Left menu → **Access reports**
3. Click **Credential report**
4. Click **Download report**

If not generated yet:

* Click **Generate credential report**
* Wait a few seconds
* Download CSV

---

## Structure of the Credential Report (Very Important)

Each **row = one IAM user**
Each **column = one security attribute**

### Key Columns Explained (Column by Column)

---

### 1. `user`

* IAM user name

---

### 2. `password_enabled`

* `true` → Console password exists
* `false` → No console access

Use case:

* Identify users who should not have console access

---

### 3. `password_last_used`

* Last time the user logged into AWS Console
* `N/A` means never logged in

Use case:

* Find inactive console users

---

### 4. `password_last_changed`

* When the console password was last rotated

Use case:

* Enforce password rotation policy

---

### 5. `password_next_rotation`

* When password must be rotated (if policy applied)

---

### 6. `mfa_active`

* `true` → MFA enabled
* `false` → MFA missing

This is one of the **most critical security columns**.

---

### 7. `access_key_1_active` / `access_key_2_active`

* Shows whether access keys exist and are active

Use case:

* Identify users using programmatic access

---

### 8. `access_key_1_last_used_date`

* Last time key was used

Very important for:

* Removing unused access keys

---

### 9. `access_key_1_last_rotated`

* Last rotation date

Use case:

* Enforce key rotation (90 days / 180 days)

---

### 10. `access_key_1_last_used_region`

* Region from which key was used

Use case:

* Detect unusual access patterns

---

### 11. `access_key_1_last_used_service`

* Service accessed using the key

Use case:

* Validate if access is expected

---

## How AWS Uses This Internally

AWS does **not block access** based on this report.
It is a **visibility and audit tool only**.

Security teams use this report to:

* Identify stale credentials
* Enforce least privilege
* Reduce attack surface
* Meet compliance requirements (ISO, SOC, PCI)

---

## Real-World Usage Flow (Conceptual)

1. Generate credential report monthly
2. Review:

   * Users without MFA
   * Unused access keys
   * Old passwords
3. Take action:

   * Disable unused keys
   * Enforce MFA
   * Delete inactive users

## Credential Report vs CloudTrail (Clear Difference)

| Feature   | Credential Report       | CloudTrail        |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Purpose   | Credential hygiene      | Activity tracking |
| Scope     | IAM users only          | All AWS services  |
| Frequency | Manual generation       | Continuous        |
| Output    | CSV snapshot            | Event logs        |
| Answers   | “Is credential secure?” | “Who did what?”   |

---

## Credential Report vs IAM Access Analyzer

* Credential Report → **User credential status**
* Access Analyzer → **Resource access exposure**
* Policy Simulator → **Permission evaluation**

All three are **different tools**, often confused.

---

## Common Findings Using Credential Report

* Users with console access but never logged in
* Access keys active but unused for months
* MFA missing for human users
* Old keys still active after employee exit

---

## Limitations (Important to Understand)

* Not real-time
* Must be regenerated manually
* Does not cover roles or SSO users
* Does not show *what* actions were performed

---

## One Clear Teaching Statement

> “IAM Credential Report is a security audit snapshot that shows the status, age, and usage of IAM user credentials across the account.”

---

## Best Practices to Mention

* Generate monthly
* Remove unused access keys
* Enforce MFA for console users
* Rotate credentials regularly
* Keep report evidence for audits
